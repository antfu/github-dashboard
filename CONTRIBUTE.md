## Development

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `>=v14`
- `pnpm` for package manager

### Install

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Startup

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then **load extension in browser with the `extension/` folder**.

For Firefox developers, you can run the following command instead:

```bash
pnpm start:firefox
```

`web-ext` auto reload the extension when `extension/` files changed.

> While Vite handles HMR automatically in the most of the case, [Extensions Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid) is still recommended for cleaner hard reloading.

### Build

To build the extension, run

```bash
pnpm build
```
